## Embedders  
  
These programs will embed the information found on their external files into the images.  

NOTE: The only tested recently were the Fooocus ones, the others are here for legacy purpose.  
  
### Fooocus  
Fooocus stored the information on a HTML file. They changed the file structure a number of times. These scripts will help embed the information into the images.  
Change the **input** and **output** paths directrly into the script.  
The version number is the last know version to work with a particular embedder.  
After 2.2.1, Fooocus has an option to embed the information directly on the image.
